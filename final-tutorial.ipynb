    "# Introduction\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "The music industry has changed a lot in the last decade with the introduction of streaming services like Apple Music or Spotify. Services like Spotify allow users to livestream music for personal consumption, often for free or for a subscription fee. These services have made it easier to consume music and have increased opportunities for people to start producing music, but they have also changed how musicians make money. Whenever a user listens to a song on a streaming service, the service typically keeps track of the number of “plays” that song has. Music artists are then paid a small amount based on the number of plays they have accumulated for their music. Given how little these artists are paid from streaming services, maximizing the amount of revenue made from a song seems pretty valuable for those looking to push out music to these services. Play count also indicates where a song stands in the streaming services’ popularity lists, and making it onto their top 100 or 200 songs is a factor considered in whether these songs are added to global, official top songs charts i.e. Billboard 200.\n",
    " \n",
    "Our group thought it would be interesting to see if we could try to make predictions for how popular a song might be given different features for a song (e.g. the genre of the song, how fast or slow it is, the key the song is written in, the time of year a song was released, how many listeners an artist already gets on average, etc.). If we can indicate how many plays a song will get, we can give a prediction for how much money a song will make on a streaming service. Much like the Moneyball scenario, it’s possible that artists are focusing on producing music that meets criteria which they think makes a song popular when, in reality, they should be focusing on other aspects of their music. Understanding what components of a song make it popular would help artists figure out the best way to produce music in order to make money off of these streaming services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Moneyball story demonstrated the importance of data science in producing a strong baseball team, and while music is different from sports, our project should hopefully reflect similar data science practices in order to reach a valuable conclusion. It may be relatively straightforward to look at aspects like which genres make the most money or whether a song by Taylor Swift will end up on the top 200 chart given her “incredibly loyal fanbase” of over 40 million people, but maybe there are other similarities between popular songs that could indicate factors which help make a song more popular. Data science practices like t-tests (maybe) or machine learning models help us here by giving us tools to help identify characteristics in a song, clarify how those characteristics might relate to play count, and predict what the play count (or popularity) for a similar song could be given factors that we have determined have an affect on play count (or popularity)\n",
    "<One valuable conclusion might be the LACK OF money artists are being paid from streaming services, or how little they make off streaming services alone>\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point forward when we use the word \"track\" it is synonymous with \"song.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal Hypothesis\n",
    "Are there traits of a song that can be used to determine future success? If so, what are they?\n",
    "## Defining Success\n",
    "We are defining the success of a track by its appearance on the Top 200, as well as its ranking on the Top 200 (the higher the better).\n"

We gather data from the [Spotify Charts Regional Top 200](https://spotifycharts.com/regional) to first identify which songs had the highest stream counts in the United States, dating back to January 1st 2017, to current day. Spotify Charts provides tracks with the highest stream count, their top 200 rank, and the artist(s) who created that song. Spotify Charts already compiles the data into Excel tables, so it isn't necessary to directly scrape from the website. If you wanted to download one yourself, at the top right of the website, select a date you'd like to download in the dropdown, then select further up \"Download to CSV.\" The pandas method read_csv() was used to process the Excel files into dataframes.\n",

    "- Acousticness\n",
    "  - A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic. \n",
    "- Energy\n",
    "  - Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. \n",
    "- Instrumentalness\n",
    "  - Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.\n",
    "- Liveness\n",
    "  - Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.\n",
    "- Loudness\n",
    "  - The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.\n",
    "- Speechiness \n",
    "  - Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks. \n",
    "- Valence\n",
    "  - A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). \n",
    "- Tempo\n",
    "  - The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following are more extraneous details for identifying tracks in the data wrangling:\n",

When obeserving the Top 200, note that the while these correlations are merely postive, when observing the top 10, they are much more strongly positvely correlated.
